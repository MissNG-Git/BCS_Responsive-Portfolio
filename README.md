# 02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

Starting with a client-provided foundation code, my task was to refactor (improve without changing functionality) the <a href="https://github.com/MissNG-Git/BCS_Code-Refactor/blob/main/Develop/index.html">HTML</a> & <a href="https://github.com/MissNG-Git/BCS_Code-Refactor/blob/main/Develop/assets/css/style.css">CSS</a> files to ensure accessibility elements were included for the site. This will allow for people with disabilities to access the website with assistive technologies and also position the site more favorably on search engines like Google ðŸ˜„ :smile: 

## Objectives
```
+ Create a mobile responsive website inclusive of three linked pages: About (Home), Contact & Portfolio
+ Utilise semantic HTML elements and lay out in a logical HTML structure
+ Utilise Bootstrap's grid system and 

+ WHEN viewing image elements : THEN FIND accessible alt attributes
+ WHEN viewing heading attributes : THEN FIND they fall in sequential order
+ WHEN viewing title element : THEN FIND a concise, descriptive title
```
