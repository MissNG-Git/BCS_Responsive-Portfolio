If you're looking for a little insight into the life of _MissNg_ <sub>(my online alias 😎)</sub>, then you've come to the right place! I designed this website as a brief intro. into my background, personality and aspirations. My short-term goal is simply to help others get to know me a bit better and have an outlet to view some of my work. My long-term goal is to further my full-stack education in the coming years which will in turn help me to build upon this website. I invite you to visit this site regularly so you can join me on my coding journey and watch how I blossom as a Web Developer~ ❀ƸӜƷ❀
